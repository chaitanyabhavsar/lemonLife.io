We don't really learn a lot of banking fundamentals in school. A whole lot of us are left clueless. We decide to go online and try to read and understand how everything works, but it just doesn't work out. There isn't really a fun interactive way of obtaining financial literacy. This is why we thought about making an interactive game that lets you follow a character's journey as she turns her lemonade stand business into a corporation. Currently, the game is a demo, but we plan to add a multiplayer feature that allows users to interact and learn with friends. At the end of the day, learning is more fun when you learn together!
